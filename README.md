### Don't forget! Three Laws of Robotics

**First Law.** A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

**Second Law.** A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

**Third Law.** A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

## Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
